 Blitz++/Python Arrays
=======================

This module offers its users a simple pythonic wrapper over `Blitz++`_ array
objects which allows for type-free manipulation of those typed objects in
Python code. It also offers a C and a `C++`_ API for efficiently converting
between :py:class:`numpy.ndarray` and the `Blitz++`_ C++ or Pythonic API.
